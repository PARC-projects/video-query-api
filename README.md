# Video Query API

This API serves as a data access layer for the Video Query project. All request made from the
[Client](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query) portion of the Video Query project are made to various endpoints
supplied by this API.  This API uses code in Video Query Algorithms as needed.
The code and documentation for the Client and Algorithms are at

- [Video Query Client](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query)
- [Video Query Algorithms](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-algorithms)

For an overview of the Video Query project please see the reference [TBD arxiv pdf](https://arxiv.org/).
